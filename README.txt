A Block to display a list of custom post type entries.

== Description ==

Osom Blocks is a block to list Custom Post Types, ideally to use with OsomPress themes.

With Osom Custom Post Type Block you can display a list of CPT entries and customize:
1. The Custom Post Type.
2. Number of posts.
3. Display/hide the featured image. 
4. Display/hide the excerpt.
5. Choose grid display
6. Choose the number of columns for the grid layout
7. Choose the title HTML markup (H2, H3 or H4).
8. Customize the "read more" text.
9. Display/hide parent post/pages (only in hierarchical Custom Post Types).
10. Display/hide pagination.

== Deprecation Notice ==

**Important:** We want to inform you that the plugin will be deprecated in future releases. For new sites we highly encourage you use the native query loop block, which now supports listing of Custom Post Types seamlessly.
We appreciate your understanding.
